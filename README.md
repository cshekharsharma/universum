![Alt Text](./docs/files/universumlogo.png)


**UniversumDB** is a high-performance key-value pair database designed for handling large number of concurrent client connections. It supports both purely in-memory storage as well as persistent LSM [(Log-structured merge tree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree) based storage engine. Currently the database is expected to run on a single node where it can take advantage of multi-core CPUs, although the distribured/clustered setup is still part of the roadmap.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or higher
- *Nix systems (linux/darwin/simiar)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cshekharsharma/universum.git
   cd universum
   ```

2. **Running Tests**
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   make build-dev [or build-prod]
   ```

4. **Build and run**
   ```bash
   make all-dev [or all-prod]


## Configuration

Universum uses a toml configuration file for configuring the server behaviour, and that file can be put anywhere on the disk with readable path that will be provided to the server at startup. The recommended path for the config file is at `/etc/universum/config.toml`.
Detailed config params and their significance are explained at [config summary document](./docs/config-summary.md).


## Usage

The server listens for TCP connections on the specified port and processes client requests. Each request is handled by a worker, which reads from the connection, processes commands, and sends the response back to the client.

### Example

To test the server using `nc`:
```bash
nc localhost 11191
```

You can then send RESP3-style commands, such as:
```
SET key value
GET key
```
